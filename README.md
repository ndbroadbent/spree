Working with the edge source (latest and greatest features)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The source code is essentially a collection of gems.  Spree is meant to be run within the context of Rails application.  You can easily create a sandbox application inside of your cloned source directory for testing purposes.


1. Clone the git repo

        git clone git://github.com/railsdog/spree.git spree
        cd spree

2. Install the gem dependencies

        bundle install

3. Create a sanbox rails application for testing purposes

        rails new sandbox -m sample/sandbox_template.rb
        cd sandbox

4. Generate the necessary Spree files

        rails g spree:site

5. Bootstrap the database (run the migrations, create admin account, optionally load sample data.)

        rake db:bootstrap

6. Prepare the test database (optional - only if you're going to run the tests)

        rake db:test:prepare

7. Start the server

        rails server

Running Tests
-------------

Once you have the edge source working (see above) you can run the tests as follows

1. Change to the directory containing the engine/gem to test

        cd core

2. Run the tests

        rspec spec
